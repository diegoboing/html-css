This DecSoft HTML Compiler sample HTML app shows how we can use the window main menu
capability to prepare a kind of navigation bar with back and forward items.

Note that for this sample we use the app's Javascript option to place the appropriate
"dhc.events.onMainMenuItemClick" function, so that function become available in the
external websites that we navigate from the app.
