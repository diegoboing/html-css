This DecSoft HTML Compiler sample HTML app show how we can open in a new app window (not the default browser window)
any arbitrary URL. By default, non existing app's files will be opened in new default browser windows, but, we can
prepare some intermediate file (like redirect.html) in order to load external URLs in new app windows.

This have some other beneficts, for example, the icon of the new app window is better placed at the Windows task bar,
by grouped the new window icons with the main executable icon.
