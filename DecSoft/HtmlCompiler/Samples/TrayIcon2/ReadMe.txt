This DecSoft HTML Compiler sample HTML app shows how we can show a tray icon
for our app and how to react when the user click on that tray icon. 

In this case we also minimize the app to the system tray when it's visible and
the tray menu item is clicked, and, restore the app window state when the tray
icon is clicked again.

Please take a look  at the index.html source and also at the program's help 
for more information.
