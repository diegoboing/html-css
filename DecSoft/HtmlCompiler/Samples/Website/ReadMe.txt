This DecSoft HTML Compiler sample HTML app show how we can redirect to
an external website from the index.html of our app.

This can be useful if we wan to "compile" a website in an standalone
executable for Windows: just redirect to the desired URL.

This sample app also show the usage of the Javascript app's option, in 
order to execute some Javascript code when the browser's webview is loaded,
even if we are in an external website and not in our app's files.
